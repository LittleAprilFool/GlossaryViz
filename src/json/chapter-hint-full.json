The\ndata consists of one or more commands, where each command consists of a single letter followed\nby any data necessary for the command.  The moveTo, lineTo, cubic Bezier, and quadratic\nBezier commands that you are already familiar with are coded by the letters M, L, C, and Q.\nThe command for closing a path segment is Z, and it requires no data.\nFor example the path data \"M\u00a010\u00a020\u00a0L\u00a0100\u00a0200\" would draw a line segment\nfrom the point (10,20) to the point (100,200).

For example, the ", " example given above could be created\nusing the ", " element", "The Z at the end of the data closes the path by adding the final side to the <span class='mark-polygon mark'>polygon</span>.\n(Note that, as usual, you can use either commas or spaces in the data.)", "The C command takes six numbers as data, to specify the two control points and the final\nendpoint of the cubic <span class='mark-Bezier_curve mark'>Bezier curve</span> segment.  You can also give a multiple of six values to get\na connected sequence of curve segements.  Similarly, the Q command uses four data values to\nspecify the <span class='mark-control_point mark'>control point</span> and final endpoint of the quadratic <span class='mark-Bezier_curve mark'>Bezier curve</span> segment.\nThe large, curvy, yellow shape shown in the picture earlier in this section was created\nas a path with two line segments and two <span class='mark-Bezier_curve mark'>Bezier curve</span> segments:", "<span class='mark-SVG mark'>SVG</span> paths add flexibility by defining \"relative\" versions of the path commands,\nwhere the data for the command is given relative to the current position.\nA relative move command, for example, instead of telling ", " to move,\ntells ", " to move from the current position.  The names of the \nrelative versions of the path commands are lower case letters instead of upper case.\n\"M\u00a010,20\" means to move to the point with coordinates (10,20), while\n\"m\u00a010,20\" means to move 10 units horizontally and 20 units vertically\nfrom the current position.

For complex scenes, we want to be able to do\n", ", where objects can be constructed from\nsub-objects, and a transform can be applied to an entire complex object.\nWe need a way to group objects so that they can be treated as a unit.\nFor that, <span class='mark-SVG mark'>SVG</span> has the ", " element.  The content of a ", "\nelement is a list of shape elements, which can be simple shapes or\nnested ", " elements.", "You can add style and ", " attributes to a ", " element.\nThe main point of grouping is that a group can be treated as a single\nobject.  A ", " <span class='mark-attribute mark'>attribute</span> in a ", " will transform the\nentire group as a whole.  A style <span class='mark-attribute mark'>attribute</span>, such as ", " or\n", ", on a ", " element will set a default value \nfor the group, replacing the current default.  Here is an example:", "The nested shapes use fill=\"none\" stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"2\" for the\ndefault values of the attributes.  The default can be overridden by specifying\na different value for the element, as is done for the stroke-width of the\n", " element in this example.

Once the object\nhas been scaled and rotated, it's easy\nto use a <span class='mark-translation mark'>translation</span> to move the reference point to any desired point in the scene.\n(Of course, in a particular case, you might not need all three operations.) Remember that in the code,\nthe transformations are specified in the opposite order from the order in which they are\napplied to the object and that the transformations are specified before drawing the\nobject.  So in the code, the <span class='mark-translation mark'>translation</span> would come first, followed by the <span class='mark-rotation mark'>rotation</span> and\nthen the <span class='mark-scaling mark'>scaling</span>.  Modeling transforms are not always composed in this order, but\nit is the most common usage.", "The modeling transformations that are used to place an object in the scene should not\naffect other objects in the scene.

The modeling transform moves the object from its natural coordinates into its\nproper place in the scene.  Then on top of that, a coordinate transform that is applied to the scene as a whole\nwould carry the object along with it.", "Now let's extend this idea.  Suppose that the object that we want to draw is itself a complex \npicture, made up of a number of smaller objects.  Think, for example, of a potted flower made up of\npot, stem, leaves, and bloom.

For example, we could draw the bloom's petals in\ntheir own coordinate systems, then apply modeling transformations to place the petals into the\nnatural <span class='mark-coordinate_system mark'>coordinate system</span> for the bloom.

To make the size of the wheels fit the cart, they need to be scaled.\nTo place them in the correct positions relative to body of the cart, one wheel must be translated\nto the left and the other wheel, to the right.  When I coded this example, I had to play\naround with the numbers to get the right sizes and positions for the wheels, and I found\nthat the wheels looked better if I also moved them down a bit.  Using the usual techniques of\nhierarchical modeling, we save the current transform before drawing each wheel, and we restore it after\ndrawing the wheel.

Indeed, we could add several carts\nto the scene, if we wanted, by calling the ", " subroutine several times with different modeling transformations.\n", "You should notice the analogy here:  Building up a complex scene out of objects is similar to\nbuilding up a complex program out of subroutines.

Furthermore,\nthere is a specialized version called OpengGL\u00a0ES for \"embedded systems\" such\nas mobile phones and tablets.  And there is also <span class='mark-WebGL mark'>WebGL</span>, for use in Web browsers,\nwhich is basically a port of <span class='mark-OpenGL mark'>OpenGL</span> ES\u00a02.0.

The server, which is responsible for controlling the computer's\ndisplay and performing graphics computations, carries out commands issued by the\nclient.  Typically, the server is a <span class='mark-GPU mark'>GPU</span>, including its graphics processors and memory.\nThe server executes <span class='mark-OpenGL mark'>OpenGL</span> commands.  The client is the <span class='mark-CPU mark'>CPU</span> in the same computer, along \nwith the application program that it is running. <span class='mark-OpenGL mark'>OpenGL</span> commands come from the\nprogram that is running on the <span class='mark-CPU mark'>CPU</span>.

The capacity of the channel can be a limiting factor in graphics\nperformance.  Think of drawing an image onto the screen.  If the <span class='mark-GPU mark'>GPU</span> can draw the\nimage in microseconds, but it takes milliseconds to send the data for the image\nfrom the <span class='mark-CPU mark'>CPU</span> to the <span class='mark-GPU mark'>GPU</span>, then the great speed of the <span class='mark-GPU mark'>GPU</span> is irrelevant\u2014most of\nthe time that it takes to draw the image is communication time.", "For this reason, one of the driving factors in the evolution of <span class='mark-OpenGL mark'>OpenGL</span> has been\nthe desire to limit the amount of communication that is needed between the <span class='mark-CPU mark'>CPU</span> and\nthe <span class='mark-GPU mark'>GPU</span>.  One approach is to store information in the GPU's memory.  If some data\nis going to be used several times, it can be transmitted to the <span class='mark-GPU mark'>GPU</span> once and\nstored in memory there, where it will be immediately accessible to the <span class='mark-GPU mark'>GPU</span>.\nAnother approach is to try to decrease the number of <span class='mark-OpenGL mark'>OpenGL</span> commands that must\nbe transmitted to the <span class='mark-GPU mark'>GPU</span> to draw a given image.", "<span class='mark-OpenGL mark'>OpenGL</span> draws ", " such as triangles.\nSpecifying a primitive means specifying ", "\nand ", " for each of its ", ".

And of course,\nthe direct production and manipulation of 2D images is an important\ntopic in its own right.  Furthermore, a lot of ideas carry over\nfrom two dimensions to three.  So, it makes sense to start\nwith graphics in 2D.", "An image that is presented on the computer screen is made up of ", ".  The screen\nconsists of a rectangular grid of pixels, arranged in rows and columns.  The pixels are small enough that\nthey are not easy to see individually.  In fact, for many very high-resolution displays, they become\nessentially invisible.  At a given time, each <span class='mark-pixel mark'>pixel</span> can\nshow only one color.  Most screens these days use 24-bit color, where\na color can be specified by three 8-bit numbers, giving the levels of red, green, and blue in the color.\nAny color that can be shown on the screen is made up of some combination of these three \"primary\" colors.\nOther formats are possible, such as ", ", where each <span class='mark-pixel mark'>pixel</span> is some shade of gray\nand the <span class='mark-pixel mark'>pixel</span> color is given by one number that specifies the level of gray on a black-to-white scale.\nTypically, 256 shades of gray are used.\nEarly computer screens used ", ", where only a small set of colors, usually\n16 or 256, could be displayed.  For an <span class='mark-indexed_color mark'>indexed color</span> display, there is a numbered list of possible colors,\nand the color of a <span class='mark-pixel mark'>pixel</span> is specified by an integer giving the position of the color in the list.", "In any case, the color values for all the pixels on the screen are stored in a large block of memory\nknown as a ", ".  Changing the image on the screen requires changing\ncolor values that are stored in the <span class='mark-frame_buffer mark'>frame buffer</span>.  The screen is redrawn many times per second, so that almost immediately\nafter the color values are changed in the <span class='mark-frame_buffer mark'>frame buffer</span>, the colors of the pixels on the screen will\nbe changed to match, and the displayed image will change.", "A computer screen used in this way is the basic model of ", ".  The term \"raster\" technically\nrefers to the mechanism used on older vacuum tube computer monitors:  An electron beam would move along\nthe rows of pixels, making them glow.  The beam was moved\nacross the screen by powerful magnets that would deflect the path of the electrons.\nThe stronger the beam, the brighter the glow of the <span class='mark-pixel mark'>pixel</span>, so the brightness of\nthe pixels could be controlled by modulating the intensity of the electron beam.  The color values\nstored in the <span class='mark-frame_buffer mark'>frame buffer</span> were used to determine the intensity of the electron beam.  (For a color\nscreen, each <span class='mark-pixel mark'>pixel</span> had a red dot, a green dot, and a blue dot, which were separately illuminated by\nthe beam.)\n", "A modern flat-screen computer monitor is not a raster in the same sense.  There is no moving\nelectron beam.  The mechanism that controls the colors of the pixels is different for different\ntypes of screen.  But the screen is still made up of pixels, and the color values for all the\npixels are still stored in a <span class='mark-frame_buffer mark'>frame buffer</span>.  The idea of an image consisting of a grid of\npixels, with numerical color values for each <span class='mark-pixel mark'>pixel</span>, defines <span class='mark-raster_graphics mark'>raster graphics</span>.\n", "Although images on the computer screen are represented using pixels, specifying individual\npixel colors is not always the best way to create an image.  Another way\nis to specify the basic geometric objects that it contains, shapes such as lines, circles,\ntriangles, and rectangles.  This is the idea that defines ", ":  Represent an\nimage as a list of the geometric shapes that it contains.  To make things more interesting,\nthe shapes can have ", ", such as the thickness of a line or the\ncolor that fills a rectangle.  Of course, not every image can be composed from simple\ngeometric shapes. This approach certainly wouldn't work for a picture of a beautiful sunset\n(or for most any other photographic image).  However, it works well for many types of\nimages, such as architectural blueprints and scientific illustrations.\n", "In fact, early in the history of computing, <span class='mark-vector mark'>vector</span> graphics was even used directly on\ncomputer screens.  When the first graphical computer displays were developed,\nraster displays were too slow and expensive to be practical.  Fortunately, it was\npossible to use vacuum tube technology in another way:  The electron beam could be made\nto directly draw a line on the screen, simply by sweeping the beam along that line.\nA <span class='mark-vector mark'>vector</span> graphics display would store a ", " of lines\nthat should appear on the screen.  Since a point on the screen would glow only very briefly\nafter being illuminated by the electron beam, the graphics display would go through\nthe <span class='mark-display_list mark'>display list</span> over and over, continually redrawing all the lines on the list.\nTo change the image, it would only be necessary to change the contents of the <span class='mark-display_list mark'>display list</span>.\nOf course, if the <span class='mark-display_list mark'>display list</span> became too long, the image would start to flicker\nbecause a line would have a chance to visibly fade before its next turn to be redrawn.\n", "But here is the point: For an image that can be specified as a reasonably small\nnumber of geometric shapes, the amount of information needed to represent the image\nis much smaller using a <span class='mark-vector mark'>vector</span> representation than using a raster representation.\nConsider an image made up of one thousand line segments.  For a <span class='mark-vector mark'>vector</span> representation\nof the image, you only need to store the coordinates of two thousand points, the\nendpoints of the lines.  This would take up only a few kilobytes of memory.  To store\nthe image in a <span class='mark-frame_buffer mark'>frame buffer</span> for a raster display would require much more memory.  \nSimilarly, a <span class='mark-vector mark'>vector</span> display could\ndraw the lines on the screen more quickly than a raster display could copy the the same image from\nthe <span class='mark-frame_buffer mark'>frame buffer</span> to the screen.  (As soon as raster displays became fast and \ninexpensive, however, they quickly displaced <span class='mark-vector mark'>vector</span> displays because of their\nability to display all types of images reasonably well.)\n", "The divide between <span class='mark-raster_graphics mark'>raster graphics</span> and <span class='mark-vector mark'>vector</span> graphics persists in several areas\nof computer graphics.  For example, it can be seen in a division between two\ncategories of programs that can be used to create images:  ", "\nand ", ".  In a <span class='mark-painting_program mark'>painting program</span>, the image is represented\nas a grid of pixels, and the user creates an image by assigning colors to pixels.\nThis might be done by using a \"drawing tool\" that acts like a painter's brush,\nor even by tools that draw geometric shapes such as lines or rectangles. But the point in a\npainting program is to color the individual pixels, and it is only the <span class='mark-pixel mark'>pixel</span> colors that are saved.\nTo make this clearer, suppose that you use a <span class='mark-painting_program mark'>painting program</span> to draw a house, then\ndraw a tree in front of the house.  If you then erase the tree, you'll only reveal a blank\nbackground, not a house.  In fact, the image never really contained a \"house\" at all\u2014only\nindividually colored pixels that the viewer might perceive as making up a picture of a house.\n", "In a <span class='mark-drawing_program mark'>drawing program</span>, the user creates an image by adding geometric shapes, and the\nimage is represented as a list of those shapes.  If you place a house shape (or collection of shapes\nmaking up a house) in the image, and you then place a tree shape on\ntop of the house, the house is still there, since it\nis stored in the list of shapes that the image contains.  If you delete the tree, the house will\nstill be in the image, just as it was before you added the tree.  Furthermore, you should be able\nto select one of the shapes in the image and move it or change its size, so drawing programs\noffer a rich set of editing operations that are not possible in painting programs.  (The reverse,\nhowever, is also true.)\n", "A practical program for image creation and editing might combine elements of painting and\ndrawing, although one or the other is usually dominant.  For example, a <span class='mark-drawing_program mark'>drawing program</span> might\nallow the user to include a raster-type image, treating it as one shape.  A painting program\nmight let the user create \"layers,\" which are separate images that can be layered one on top\nof another to create the final image.  The layers can then be manipulated much like the shapes\nin a <span class='mark-drawing_program mark'>drawing program</span> (so that you could keep both your house and your tree in separate layers,\neven if in the image of the house is in back of the tree).\n", "Two well-known graphics programs are ", " and ", ".\n", " is in the category of painting programs, while ", " is more of a <span class='mark-drawing_program mark'>drawing program</span>.\nIn the world of free software, the GNU image-processing program, ", ", is a good alternative\nto ", ", while ", " is a reasonably capable free <span class='mark-drawing_program mark'>drawing program</span>.\nShort introductions to Gimp and Inkscape can be found in ", ".", "The divide between raster and <span class='mark-vector mark'>vector</span> graphics also appears in the field of graphics file formats.\nThere are many ways to represent an image as data stored in a file.  If the original image\nis to be recovered from the bits stored in the file, the representation must follow some exact, known\nspecification.  Such a specification is called a graphics file format.  Some popular graphics file\nformats include GIF, PNG, JPEG, and <span class='mark-SVG mark'>SVG</span>.  Most images used on the Web are GIF, PNG, or JPEG.\nModern web browsers also have support for <span class='mark-SVG mark'>SVG</span> images.\n", "GIF, PNG, and JPEG are basically <span class='mark-raster_graphics mark'>raster graphics</span> formats; an image is specified by storing a color \nvalue for each <span class='mark-pixel mark'>pixel</span>.  GIF is an older file format,\nwhich has largely been superseded by PNG, but you can still find GIF images on the web.  (The GIF\nformat supports animated images, so GIFs are often used for simple animations on Web pages.) GIF uses\nan indexed <span class='mark-color_model mark'>color model</span> with a maximum of 256 colors.  PNG can use either indexed or full 24-bit color,\nwhile JPEG is meant for full color images. \n", "The amount of data necessary to represent a raster image can be quite\nlarge.  However, the data usually contains a lot of redundancy, and the data can be \"compressed\"\nto reduce its size.  GIF and PNG use ", ", which means that the\noriginal image can be recovered perfectly from the compressed data.\nJPEG uses a ", " algorithm,\nwhich means that the image that is recovered from\na JPEG file is not exactly the same as the original image; some information has been lost.\nThis might not sound like a good idea, but in fact the difference is often not very noticeable, and\nusing lossy compression usually permits a greater reduction in the size of the compressed data.\nJPEG generally works well for photographic images, but not as well for images that have sharp edges\nbetween different colors.
