Visualizing the glossary table after computing science textbook

- visualize the relationship between technical terminologies in the glossary table from computing science textbooks
- use arc diagram/network maps
- evaluate with a small study (e.g., the book "Software Engineering" and undergraduate students who are taking "Software Engineering" this term)
